• Infosys Springboard [ ]
AI Intern
July 2025- Oct 2025
Mysore, India
◦ Developed the Ridewise Bike Sharing Demand App, boosting prediction accuracy from 90% to 96%
(+6.67% gain) on a 50K-sample dataset by engineering 15+ time-series features from weather APIs and
urban event data, reducing forecasting errors by 25% during peak hours.
◦ Built an Explainable AI pipeline using spline-based modeling for time-series features, cutting visualization
processing time by 40% and enabling stakeholders to interpret 95% of demand trends intuitively via
interactive dashboards.
◦ Uncovered actionable insights via Permutation Importance and SHAP values, pinpointing top-5 features
(e.g., temperature, events) that drove 68% of variance; presented to team, influencing demand optimization
strategies projected to increase revenue by 12%.
Projects
• Real-Time E-Commerce Fraud Detection System | FastAPI,Flink,Redis,Docker,Grafana
Tools: Python, LightGBM, Isolation Forest, Flink, Redis, Docker, FastAPI, Optuna, Prometheus,Grafana
Jan’26-Feb’26
[
]
◦ Designed end-to-end pipeline handling 10K+ TPS with <50ms p99 latency, slashing false positives by 40%
on simulated 1M daily transactions.
◦ Engineered hybrid LightGBM + Isolation Forest models, delivering 94% F1-score (vs. 87% baseline) on
5:95 imbalanced fraud data
◦ Engineered 20+ real-time features (e.g., transaction velocity, geolocation anomalies) using Apache Flink
stateful processing and Feast Feature Store (Redis online: <10ms retrieval), achieving 95% pipeline
consistency, 2x faster computation, and 100% elimination of training-serving skew.
◦ Deployed scalable FastAPI microservice on AWS ECS (Dockerized), with Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
alerting on 99.5% uptime.
• Ames House Prices Prediction App | Python, XGBoost, Ridge Regression, Streamlit
Tools: Python, XGBoost, Ridge Regression, Streamlit, SHAP, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Kaggle Ames dataset
April 2025-May 2025
[
◦ Built interactive ML app predicting prices for 1,000+ Ames houses, boosting R² from 0.82 to 0.88 via
XGBoost ensembles and Ridge Regression baselines on Kaggle dataset.
◦ Engineered 15+ features (sqft, rooms, garage, amenities) with outlier clipping (z-score >3) reducing
RMSE by 12% from baseline.
◦ Deployed real-time Streamlit app handling 50+ predictions/minute, with interactive feature importance
plots.
